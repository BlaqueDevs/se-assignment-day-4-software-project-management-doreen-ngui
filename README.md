## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each
    A.Waterfall
    It is a sequential, linear approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) is completed before the next begins.
    Advantages
     Clear structure and documentation.
     Predictable timelines and budgets (in theory).
     Suitable for projects with stable requirements.
    Disadvantages
     Inflexible; difficult to adapt to changes.
     Testing occurs late in the process, making it difficult to fix errors.
     Limited customer involvement.
    B.Agile
    It is an iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
    Advantages
     Highly adaptable to changing requirements.
     Frequent customer feedback and involvement.
     Faster time to market for working software.
     Higher quality due to constant testing.
    Disadvantages
     Less predictable timelines and budgets.
     Requires strong collaboration and communication.
     Can be challenging to manage large, complex projects.
